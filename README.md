- 👋 Hi, I’m @Motlakz
- 👀 I love to code and am riding the train to JavaScript Valley!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack JavaScript and my Working Tech Stack is Ruby on Rails. I guess you can say I am juggling the best of both worlds as much as I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Website Building Projects using JS, CSS & HTML. Eventually, I will work my way up to Web Apps and useful tools to solve huge problems in the industry.
